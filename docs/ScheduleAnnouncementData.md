------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**message** | [**ScheduleAnnouncementDataMessage**](ScheduleAnnouncementDataMessage.md) |  | 
**messageType** | **String** | Specifies the type of the message, which can be either MESG for a text message and ADMM for an admin message. | [optional] 
**userId** | **String** | Specifies the unique ID of the sender when the message.type is MESG. When the message.type value is ADMM, this property is not effective. | [optional] 
**content** | **String** | Specifies the content of the message. | [optional] 
**targetAt** | **String** | Specifies the target channels to send the announcement to. Acceptable values are the following: &lt;br/&gt; - sender_all_channels (Default): sends the announcement to all of the sender&#39;s group channels.&lt;br /&gt;- target_channels: sends the announcement to all target group channels. When the &#x60;message.type&#x60; of the announcement is ADMM, this is the only valid option. &lt;br /&gt; - target_users_included_channels: sends the announcement to group channels consisting of the sender, target users, and other members. &lt;br/&gt; - target_users_only_channels: sends the announcement to group channels consisting of the sender and target users only. | 
**targetList** | **[String]** | Specifies an array of one or more target user IDs or target channel URLs to send the announcement to when the target_at is  target_channels, target_users_only_channels, or target_users_included_channels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  When the target_at value is sender_all_channels, this property is not effective. | 
**targetChannelType** | **String** | Determines which type of group channel to send the announcement to, based on the target_at and target_list. This property is effective only when the target_at is either target_users_only_channels or target_users_included_channels and the target_list is specified. Acceptable values are limited to the following:&lt;br/&gt;- all: send the announcement to all channels that have all target users and the sender in them, regardless of channel type.&lt;br/&gt;- distinct (default): sends this announcement to the distinct channels. Distinct channels continue to use the same existing channels whenever someone attempts to create a new channel with the same members.&lt;br/&gt;- non-distinct: sends this announcement to the non-distinct channels. Non-distinct channels always create a new channel even if there is an existing channel with the same members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The distinct and non-distinct channels are a subtype of group channels, determined by the [is_distinct](/docs/chat/v3/platform-api/guides/group-channel#2-types-of-a-channel-3-resource-representation) property. | 
**uniqueId** | **String** | Specifies the unique ID of the new announcement. The unique_id will be automatically created unless specified. | [optional]

**createChannel** | **Boolean** | Determines whether to create a new channel if there is no existing channel that matches with the target options including target_at and target_list. By specifying the create_channel_options, you can configure the properties of newly created channels. (Default: false) | [optional] 
**announcementGroup** | **String** | Specifies the announcement group that the new announcement belongs to.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This property is effective only when the target_at is either target_users_only_channels or target_users_included_channels. | [optional]

**ceaseAt** | **String** | Specifies the time to temporarily put the announcement on hold in UTC. The string is represented in HHMM format.

**resumeAt** | **String** | Specifies the time to automatically resume the on-hold announcement in UTC. The string is represented in HHMM format. This should be specified in conjunction with the cease_at property above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If both the cease_at and resume_at are not specified, Sendbird server starts to send the announcement at the time of the scheduled_at above. | [optional] 
**endAt** | **Number** | Specifies the time to permanently end the announcement, in [Unix milliseconds](/docs/chat/v3/platform-api/guides/miscellaneous##2-timestamps) format. If this property is specified, the announcement ends even when the announcement is not sent to all its targets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For the announcement to run safely, the end_at time should be set at least 10 minutes later than the scheduled_at time. | [optional]
